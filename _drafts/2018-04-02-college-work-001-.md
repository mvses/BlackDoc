## College 3D Project 001

Throughout the year, the various classes in 3D and vfx have been enjoyable and inspiring, I've found gaps in my knowledge but with the tutoring I've been given I've been able to fill those gaps and progress. In particular Lighting and compositing was the class that I wasn't to interested in when I first heard the name, but soon after became very interested in technicalities surrounding the topic. I myself try to take a technical approach after learning the creative aspect, so learning about lighting, compositing and the various other elements that need to be incorporated into it to create great looking visuals, for example learning what is physical based rendering, understanding properties of light such as fall off, image processing such as pixel manipulation like good 'ol *multiply* all this has given me such a good understanding of visual development such as lighting, shading, rendering, and compositing.
