My name is Moses Eribo, previously studying computer science. 
I rekindled my love of art and pursued a career in 3D art and vfx. I then rekindled my love
of computer science, and have been on a journey of trying to utilize both skill sets 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main(){
    std::vector<int> v;
    
    for(int value; std::cin >> value;)
        v.push_back(value);
}
```
```bash
ls -l a
```
