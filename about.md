My name is Moses Eribo, previously studying computer science. 
I rekindled my love of art and pursued a career in 3D art and vfx. I then rekindled my love
of computer science, and have been on a journey of trying to utilize both skill sets 

```c++
#include <iostream>
int main(){
    std::cout << "Something Borrowed" << std::endl;
}
```
