After gaining some inspiration, from finding some great examples of motion graphics on twitter, I decided to attempt to learn after effects like i promised myself 2 months ago. 

great decision

Even after using Illustrator and photoshop layers in After Effects have always been this mysterious entity that I could never really get to work in my favour. So after viewing a tutorial by the awesome [Andrew Kramer](http://www.videocopilot.net/) I can safely say, I still have a way to go, but I'm alot closer than I was before. We played with expressions, effects and layers, for someone with a background in 3d and vfx already this was the best type of tutorial, jumping head first taking notes along the way. My end result barely resembles the tutorial but my intention was to learn the ropes... Then start swinging.
